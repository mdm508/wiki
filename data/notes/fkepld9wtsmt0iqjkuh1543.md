Today I have my first chinese book club disscussion. I didn't read the book.
I started reading the summary but didn't finish that either. I should
probably finish now instead of writting this.

My dad's birthday is tommorow and I am not sure what to buy him. I think
I will make him some bagels. 

I want to give myself an hour of free learning on supermemo each day. It
would be a really nice way to undwind at night time. I will try bringing
my labtop in the living room to encourage myself.
