### What would make today great?
### Amazing things that happened today
### How could I have made today even better?

<p>I started the morning with a meditation. This felt right. I had been
starting with a workout but I noticed I wasn't very focused. I want to bring
more focus to whatever it is I am doing. I notice in the midst of my daily
life I am often thinking about other things and not the work thats infront
of me. I find this a bit tiring and think I would enjoy life more if paide close
attention to what is infront of me.</p>
